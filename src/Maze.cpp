/*
Find if there is a connecting path between two given points in the maze.
The maze is a matrix of order MxN, check if there exists a path between (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
Two points are said to connected if there is a series of 1's non-diagonally.
Example:
Maze of order 4x4:

1	0	1	0
1	1	0	0
0	1	0	1
0	1	1	1

(x1,y1):(0,0)
(x2,y2):(2,3)

In this case, there exists a connected path:
1
1	1
	1		1
	1	1	1

Since there is a connected path, your function has to return 1.
If a path doesn't exist between two co-ordinates then return 0.
If the co-ordinates are invalid or size of the matrix is invalid then return 0.

Function Prototype :path_exists(int *maze, int rows, int columns, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) ;
Maze: Pointer to first element of an array .
rows : No of rows
columns : Columns
x1,x2,y1,y2: Co-ordinates

Hint : You can use path_exists as a wrapper function for your original recursive function which might take
more parameters .
